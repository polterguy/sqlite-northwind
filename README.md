# SQLite northwind database

Northwind SQLite database script plugin for Magic that installs the Northwind database into your _"/etc/sqlite/templates/"_ folder for you, for then to execute the SQL script, creating the Northwind database for you, allowing you to play around with the CRUD generator with a real database. This SQL script is a version of the Microsoft Access 2000 Northwind sample database, re-engineered for SQLite. The original Northwind sample database was provided with Microsoft Access as a tutorial schema for managing small business customers, orders, inventory, purchasing, suppliers, shipping, and employees. Northwind is an excellent tutorial schema for a small-business ERP, with customers, orders, inventory, purchasing, suppliers, shipping, employees, and single-entry accounting. All the TABLES and VIEWS from the MSSQL-2000 version have been converted to Sqlite3 and are included here.
